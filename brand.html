                            Kobe Bryant's contract with Nike was a multi-year endorsement deal that began in 
                            2003 and continued until his tragic passing in 2020. This partnership made Kobe 
                            one of Nike's most iconic and enduring athlete collaborators. The contract included 
                            signature shoe lines, apparel, and various promotional commitments, cementing Kobe's 
                            legacy as one of the most influential figures in basketball and sports culture.
